# Codebase stewardship

Through codebase stewardship, we help public source code and policy code products become [successful](success-for-a-codebase.md).
We help codebases be:

* collaboratively developed
* maintained at scale
* reused widely and sustainable

We can provide codebase stewardship from the beginning of the development or for [existing projects](for-existing-projects.md).

## What codebase stewardship is

* [resources to help explain what codebase stewardship is](explaining-stewardship/index.md)
* [activities we perform in codebase stewardship](activities.md)
* [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md)

## How codebase stewardship works

* [the codebase stewardship lifecycle](lifecycle.md)
* [how codebase stewardship works for existing projects](for-existing-projects.md)

## Useful resources

* [criteria we use to assess whether a codebase is ready and suitable for incubation](criteria-for-codebase-stewardship.md)
* [product assets needed during early incubation](product-assets-for-early-incubation.md)
* [stewardship proposal we can send to principal maintainers](stewardship-proposal-template.md)
