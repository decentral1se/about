# Procurement process

This is how we procure all services and some goods.

1. We request a proposal or quote.
2. We check if price and value are in line with the market.
3. We check that the proposed procurement meets our [procurement principles](principles.md).
4. The [operations team](../../organization/staff.md#operations) places the order, after approval by the chief executive and board of directors, if needed.
