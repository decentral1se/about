# Communications plan

## Principles

Our communications need to reflect our core values: open, quality, trust, community, helpful. They must also be non-partisan, in line with our [founding principles](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html#founding-principles).

Our messages are positive and inspirational. Our community won’t be sustainable if we attract people motivated by fear or anger.

Our communications are in plain English, but we link to highly relevant pages in other languages, for example about our members’ work.

Our communications should show to showcase the Foundation as:

* active, dynamic, getting things done
* smart enough to be trusted with the importance and complexity of its work
* plugged into and supportive of the network of visionaries and activists who also want this future
* open, both about its intentions and operations (transparency) as well as learnings, failures and successes

We believe it’s more important to talk concretely about what we’ve already done than what we hope to do.

## Mission statement

To enable public-purpose software and policy that is open and collaborative.

## Business objectives

1. Get more members ([in phase 1](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/roadmap.html))
2. Boost public codebases under Foundation stewardship
3. Build our codebase community and attract more contributors
4. Get more contributors and funding for the Foundation
5. Boost the public code ecosystem

## Audience

Our audience is divided into:

* current Foundation users
* future Foundation users
* influencers

### Foundation users

We believe [these are the users of the Foundation for Public Code](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/value-and-impact/user-mapping/).


### Influencers

These are domain celebrities in open source, government digital transformation and civic tech.

## Unique selling proposition

We are the only organization focused on open source software for public organizations that:

- is non-profit and member owned (unlike commercial open source govtech companies)
- offers codebase stewardship for different projects (how are we different from the Commons Conservancy and the businesses they can put you in touch with?)
- offers productization and marketing of the codebases (unlike Commons Conservancy)
- actually provides guidance and support to help public orgs make their code open (unlike Free Software Foundation)
- isn’t tied to the EU project lifecycle (unlike SCORE)
- has a reproducible process suitable not just for cities, but all public organizations (unlike SCORE)
- is international (unlike OS2, Cloud 4 Cities, VNG-Realisatie, Adullact)

We are also actively building our ecosystem by:

- connecting members with like-minded parties (potential members, partners, affiliates, structural funders)
- boosting awareness of public code
- setting standards and creating reusable resources (by providing thought leadership!)
- demonstrating the value of public code with well documented, public business cases and risk analyses
- nurturing our community online, and at conferences and events

## Calls to action

### Decision makers and sponsors

This includes:

- [political](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/member-relations/user-mapping/political.html)
- [senior civil servants](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/member-relations/user-mapping/senior-civil-servants.html)
- structural funding and philanthropy

Messages:

- Find out more about [place or institution’s] interesting public code(ish) approach/project
- Find out more about the Foundation’s work (new member signed up, new codebase incubated)
- Find out more about the Foundation’s vision
- International movements/partnerships for being smarter about technology/digital infrastructure (“you want to be part of this club of innovators”)
- Find out more about the Standard and certification (how we contribute to risk reduction)
- Find out more about codebase reuse (multiplying tech investment or saving money)

### Users and contributors

This includes:

- the policy community
- the tech and open source communities
- business management and procurement for public administrations

Messages:

- Find out more about [place or institution’s] interesting technological approach to public code or open source (objective: creating an enabling environment within government by showing this is normal elsewhere)
- Find out more about [place or institution’s] interesting policy approach to public code or open policymaking (objective: creating an enabling environment within government by showing this is normal elsewhere)
- Find out more about [place or institution’s] interesting management approach to procuring or producing public code or open source code (objective: creating an enabling environment within government by showing this is normal elsewhere)
- Find out more about the Standard and our other resources for different user groups
- Come to meetups and events
- News from and profiles of our contributor community (‘join our thriving community!’)

### Other interested parties

This includes:

- vendors and the private sector
- end users (residents and citizens)
- journalists, academia and non-governmental organizations

    Messages:

- Good news from our partners and affiliates (eg, relevant session at organization X’s annual conference!)
- Any news about Foundation or codebase impact for end users (eg, check out these communications by a member about their new software for managing parking)
- State of the market info about/for vendors (focusing on a class of vendors, rather than endorsing specific vendors)
- Potentially: announcing when a new vendor becomes available to support a specific codebase (like [this OS2 example](https://os2.eu/blog/en-ny-leverandoer-til-os2kitos-fra-juni-2019))

## Channels

Our channels are:

- Our blog: long form, platform of record (read more about our blog)
- Twitter: short form, ephemera
- Facebook: medium form, ephemera (mostly avoid, since it’s a closed platform)
- LinkedIn: reshare content created about us and posted by others, or replicate FB (mostly avoid, since it’s a closed platform)

Our posting frequency is:

- Twitter - as often as we have something to say, up to daily. It’s dynamic, responsive, topical.
- Other channels: when we have something to say.
- Blogposts: to be determined based on our news cycle and how much work blogposts turn out to be. Starting guesstimate: we should publish at least once every 3 weeks, and not more than 3 times per week.

Scheduling days of the week for maximum engagement

- We aim to publish blogposts and jobs on Mondays (for maximum engagement).
- The bulk of our social media engagement should take place Monday to Thursday.

## Messaging matrix

We don’t know what the ideal ratio of audiences to target is yet. We’ll develop as we learn more about who actually engages with us.

## Campaigns

We run a campaign every time:

- someone from the Foundation speaks at an event
- we hit a [milestone](https://github.com/publiccodenet/about/pull/224)

### Campaign template

This should be tied into general strategy sessions, so we get the maximum impact from each event or milestone. These are generally structured as:

- Announcement that thing is happening (give teaser)
- Join in on other related conversations and hashtags (monitor conversation)
- Tweet about the thing as it’s happening
- Publish blog during (if a major announcement/unveiling) or afterwards about what happened, plus what we learned or what’s next
- Measure how this worked

## Metrics

These are statistics we can easily track month on month as a proxy for impact:

- tweet numbers
- new Twitter followers
- Twitter profile visits
- Twitter mentions
- tweet impressions
- increased use of #publiccode
- reuse or citation of our resources (including blogposts)
- positive news stories about the Foundation for Public Code
- website visitor numbers as provided by our hosting platform

Our ability to get metrics is limited by the fact that we have [no analytics tracking](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/privacy.html) on our websites.
