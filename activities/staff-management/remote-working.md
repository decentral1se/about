# Remote working at the Foundation for Public Code

Inline with the data and guidelines of the [European Centre Disease prevention and Control Covid-19 response (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china), which posts [a daily update on their website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/current-risk-assessment-novel-coronavirus-situation); As well as that of the [National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM)](https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19) ([also available in Dutch](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19)) we've decided that everyone should work remotely if possible.

## Information sharing

1. Always CC the relevant group email. Our groups are: stewards, membership, events, giving, invoices, hr, security, Amsterdam-office and everyone (includes everyone with an @publiccode.net email account).
2. We'll use Odoo Discuss instead of Gchat for office conversation. The channels should make it easier for someone in a different time zone to catch up with relevant conversations.
3. We're going to try to work Odoo-first for our secret work, so that we all have access and contribute to the same structured information.

## Meetings

To best support people working remotely during important meetings or events, we'll:

* map out what they'll need at the meeting or event,
* make sure people start working together early enough so we're prepared for the meeting (including contingency),
* schedule a retro after each important meeting or event so we can improve the planning and remote collaboration.
